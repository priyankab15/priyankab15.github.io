          <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
          <p>
            So, I would like to conlude that PASSNYC should focus on schools in
            cities like, East Elmhurst, Flushing, Astoria, Cambria Heights. PASSNYC
            should also check whether students have registered for SHSAT exam
            and who have appeared or not for that exam. PASSNYC should create awareness
            among schools that are not registering for this exam. If students
            have any other concers they should investigate and find the reasons
            and be able to help them out. If they are registering and not giving
            exam, they should be provided with required sources of preparation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For further analysis, PASSNYC can collect data of students who physical
            disabilities and can provide speacil requirements from them. They can
            also analyze which part of New York have more such students and can focus
            more on them. They can also analyze more deep in finding out ways
            to create awareness among students about this non-profit organization.
