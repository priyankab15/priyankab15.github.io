          <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
          <p>
            There are many passionate and talented kids who are willing to achieve
            great things in life but have very limited resources because of their
            financial background. So, such students deserve to have an opportunity.
            A non-profit organization like PASSNYC is dedicated to focus on these
            students to broaden their educational opportunities in New York city as
            it is the city of most impressive educational institutions in the world.
            PASSNYC uses public data to identity such students within New York city.
            It advices students to take Specialized High School Admission Tests
            (SHSAT), which helps them to decide underperformed students and can
            help them.
