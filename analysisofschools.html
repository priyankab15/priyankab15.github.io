            factors are effecting them, how are students in New york city schools,
            followed by students performaces in schools. So, this page would give

          <h3>Distribution of Schools in New York city</h3>
          <p>
            The below graph shows the number of schools in each of the New york City.
            From the graph, we can say that New York, Brooklyn has the maximum
            number of schools.

          <h3>Attacking the Absent ratio</h3>
          <p>
            Now, let's focus to find the schools that consist of chronically absent
            students. Though providing of many resources to schools, the chances
            of improving would be low if students are not attending the schools.
            So, for this reason let's focus on schools with low absent rate.
