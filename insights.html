          <h3>SHSAT Exam Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            The performance of students is analyzed by SHSAT exam so now the focus
            is to analyze how many students are giving this exam each year.
          </p>
          <div id="shsatexam_year_div" style="height:500px, width:600px;"></div>
          <p>
            As this is mostly focused on higher grade students, so let's see how
            many of 8th and 9th standard students are giving this exam.
          </p>
          <div id="grade_level_div" style="height:500px, width:600px;"></div>
          <div id="studentsshasatexam_div" class="graphs"></div>
          <div id="ela_exam_div" class="graphs"></div>
          <div id="math_exam_div" class="graphs"></div>
          <p>
            From the above graphs we can say that students in cities East Elmhurst,
            Cambridge heights, Astoria are scoring less grades. So, PASSNYC can focus
            to analyze these areas.
